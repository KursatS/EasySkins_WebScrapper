<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Web Scrapper

A fairly simple console application, I have shared the necessary comments above the code blocks.
If you want to test the code, you can do so using a Steam account with 2FA protection disabled.
The application logs the incoming colors in the root directory. <br><br>

The inputs you need to change are marked with '*' in the program.cs file.<br>
This app contains EdgeDriver so u have to use Edge as browser. If u want to use the other browsers.<br>
You need to download neccessary driver from NuGet packages.
